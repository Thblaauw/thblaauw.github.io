					<h3>Introduction</h3>

					<p>The goal of this project was to develop a city building game using Unity3D and pre-built assets found on open-source websites. This project was completely done using C# for Unity3D. The was designed so that the player was required to build and upgrade a city using limited supplies such as wood, food, and people, as well as preparing for enemy cities (Artificial Intelligence enemy) to attack the playerâ€™s city. The artifical intelligence would adapt its strategy of attack depending on its success and/or failure.</p>

					<h3>Description</h3>

					<p>This game is my Senior Project. I developed this game throught my Spring Semester of 2020. I first started by designing the game and defining what would be the challenges the player would face during gameplay and possible strategies that the player could use in order to overcome such challenges. The designing process took a total with 4 weeks, with multiple iterations of the game built on paper until a desired gameplay was achieved combining feedback from playtesters and my observations.</p>

					<p>On the final iteration of the game, the player was able to pursue 3 strategies that would lead to victory: military strength, civic leadership, and scientific supremacy. Each of these three strategies are balanced in the game and counterbalance each other. For instance, a military strentgh strategy would be strong against scientific supremacy, but would weak to civic leadership. Obviously balancing these three strategies so something that required fine tunning and a much bigger sample pool which I did not have available on the time of development.</p>

					<p>The game was also designed to support online gameplay and have multiple players attack each other and steal resources that they could use to improve their own city. During development, to replace online players and to test gameplay mechanics, I programmed an Aritifical Intelligence that would adapt "its game strategy" to be more succesfull in attacking the player.</p>
