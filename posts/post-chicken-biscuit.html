					<h3>Description</h3>

					<p>This game is the first title pusblished by Fidgety Boys Studios. The game is still in development and it is currently in open beta. The initial idea for this title was to create an arcade game for Android using Unity3D's components. Initially, The Adventures of Chicken Biscuit was a simple physics game in which the player needed to walk around the screen collecting points and dodging enemy projectiles.</p>

					<p>After the initial playtest stage, we evalutated the type of game we wanted to make and took into consideriation our initial user reports. We quickly realised that a physics-based game would be more enjoyable, and I led the programming team into implementing Unity3D's physics components into the game. I was also responsible for designing and implementing player behavior, enemy behavior and UI elements of the game, as well as, projectile detection, and mobile compatibility.</p>

					<p>Currently, I am responsible for coordinating debugging sprints and designing and implementing new levels and mechanics to grow the game. I work directly with the art lead to design new enemies and projectiles to be implemented into the game.</p>
